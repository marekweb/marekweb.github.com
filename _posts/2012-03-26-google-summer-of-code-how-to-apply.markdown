title: "Google Summer of Code: How to Apply & What to Expect" 
---


When I first heard of the [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012) I was surprised I hadn't heard of it earlier. The premise of the program is simple: you spend a summer working on an open-source project online. And you receive mentoring and a financial stipend while you do it. The one condition is being a student over the age of 18.

I participated in the GSoC in summer 2011 and I had a very rewarding experience. It's a bit of a hidden jewel of summer student work (in the software field, at least). The experience you get from a summer of working on a prominent open-source software project can be extremely valuable, and it will definitely catch the eye of your future prospective employers.

My own project involved prototyping a HTML5 application for the [Cytoscape Web](http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/) project, and I had the opportunity to work with some remarkably talented mentors --- Christian Tannus Lopes and Max Franz --- from the [Bader lab](http://baderlab.org/) which specializes in computational biology.

Any student can apply to the GSoC, from anywhere in the world. All projects involve some degree of software programming, although you don't necessarily need to be studying in a software field. The entirety of the program happens online, so no travel is required.

## How it works

The GSoC program is composed of a number of mentoring organizations. In 2012, this number was 180, an increase from 150 in 2011. Each mentoring organization reresents one or more open-source projects.

Applying to GSoC as a student involves submitting a proposal to a particular mentoring organization. You begin by browsing the list of participating organizations and picking one (or several) projects to apply to.

Most mentoring organizations publish lists of proposal ideas that they'd like students to work on. These ideas can vary greatly in scope and difficulty: some might be updates to existing code, and others might be entire new features. You'll find that a remarkable variety of software is represented, from low-level embedded applications to large web software.

## Student slots

Google grants a number of student slots to each organization. This number of slots is the limit to how many students the organization can accept in the program.

The number of slots varies between mentoring organizations, and is determined by Google based on factors such as how many previous years the organization has participated in the GSoC, as well as the success rate of its previous GSoC students.

What are your chances of being accepted? It depends on the organization you apply to. While the more well-known organizations receive the most proposals, they also usually have more student slots available.

The selection of student proposals is performed entirely by the mentoring organizations. Google doesn't play a role in the selection process.

## The evaluations

Google provides you with a financial stipend on the condition that your project is a success. There are two evaluations: one half-way through the term, and one at the end. Your mentors provide Google with a pass/fail result at each evaluation, and this determines whether or not you get your paycheck.

Your mentors will usually use your proposal as a basis for determining whether or not your work has reached its goals. But it doesn't mean that your proposal dictates everything: it's natural to change the plan as you go along, when you encounter unexpected challenges or find out that you've overestimated your abilities.

## How to avoid problems

The most common problem that students face is not communicating enough with their mentors.

I suggest to communicate with your mentors at a minumum frequency of once per week. Ideally, you should be giving progress reports more often than this --- even if they're just short status updates.

The most important time to communicate is when things aren't going well. If you're having difficulties, you should let your mentors know right away. There's a tendency for people to stop communicating when they're struggling with a task, because they're afraid to admit that they're having trouble. Take the opposite approach: the moment that you hit a road block, even if it's minor, tell your mentors and ask them for advice. Together with your mentors, you'll either solve the problem or you'll change the project goals to get around it. At the end of the day, your mentors are really on your side.

## Criteria for a successful proposal

For each mentoring organization that you want to apply to, first check their specific proposal instructions. Some organizations want a very specific format, and they won't accept anything else. Others might not give instructions, in which case you have to figure how to structure your proposal yourself.

Also carefully read the organization's list of proposal ideas, if they have one. Some mentors prefer proposals that very directly target the ideas they've published, so you might have a better chance if your proposal addresses one of them specifically.

Open the lines of communication early. Don't just submit the proposal and remain silent, but talk with the mentors. Find the organization's discussion group or IRC channel and introduce yourself there. This can make a big difference.

## Writing the proposal

As part of your proposal, you're usually expected to outline the deliverables that you plan to produce. These should be specific, as they'll be used by your mentors to determine whether your project has been successful or not.

Your proposal should also include a timeline for your work. The idea is also to show that you have a realistic idea of how much work will be involved. It also greatly helps your mentors to keep track of whether you're on track to finishing the work on time.

Finally, it's valuable to include a few words about yourself and your skills, as well as a few references to past projects you've worked on. You don't have to be an expert, of course. It's more about showing that you are eager to dive in and learn new things.

Overall, your goal is to show that you've carefully thought about your project, and that you'll be able to successfully complete it. It's no use putting unrealistic goals in your plan: stick to what you think you can do, and explain why you think you're capable of doing it.

Once you've submitted your proposal on the online GSoC system, try to get feedback from the mentors. Use the comment system to answer questions they might have, and ask your own questions. The better the dialogue you have with your mentors, the better your chances of being accepted, because a big part of what mentors look for in students is the ability to communicate well.

To summarize, here's what a good GSoC proposal should contain (unless the mentoring organization has its own instructions):

- An outline of the components or deliverables that you'll work on. Make it detailed: subdivide the plan into many smaller features.
- A task schedule. This is where you show that you have a realistic estimate for how much work needs to be done. Give a time estimate for each of your outlined tasks, even if it's really approximate. Your mentors will later help you improve it.
- A brief summary of your own experience or past work. Have you worked on similar software before? Have you contributed to open source software? It might give you an advantage.

To top it off, try to show that you're easy to communicate with. Every mentor's nightmare is a student who is never available and takes days to respond to emails. Communicate with your prospective mentors both before and after you've submitted your application.

## Multiple proposals

If you submit more than one proposal, you will have higher chances of getting accepted somewhere. There is no limit to how many proposals you can submit. But make sure that each proposal is written specifically for the organization you're submitting to! It's no use mass-submitting multiple copies of the same proposal --- it'll quickly get discared.

Because writing multiple proposals is a lot of work, it can also be a viable choice to submit a single one, and put all your effort into it. It's also a lot easier when it's a proposal that you're excited about, because the enthusiasm you convey will be noticeable. I was accepted in 2011 having submitted only one proposal, but I was really interested in working on it.

## Getting accepted

The big question in the application process is: will I get accepted? Although the GSoC is pretty competitive, a well-written proposal might give you better chances than you might think. Consider the numbers:

- In 2011, 3,731 students applied to the GSoC.
- Of those, 1,115 students were accepted, or about 30%.
- Many of the rejected applications were "useless", i.e. they weren't complete or legitimate.

With a proper, complete proposal, the likelihood of getting in is pretty good. Pick your mentoring organizations well and submit multiple complete proposals, and it might be even better.

It doesn't cost anything to give it a try, so go for it.
